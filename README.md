## Examples
A few examples are provided in the `./examples` folder. These demonstrate different aspects of PaCPAL and are as follows:

### Inlining (`inline.sk`)
Demonstrates the inlining of power-law equations in PaCPAL:

```
# Here we're declaring some Zipf equations inline and binding them to a name.
zipf 0.0011742221285749555 -0.6588793976685547 as 000webhostbasic8prop
zipf 0.0009680954123045289 -0.6479434369803485 as 000webhostbasic8uni

# Another assertion.
assert 000webhostbasic8prop steeper 000webhostbasic8uni between 1 and 1000
```

The `zipf` keyword allows the inline creation of a named power-law equation. Those above are of the form:

```
000webhostbasic8prop = [y = 0.0011742221285749555 * x^-0.6588793976685547]
000webhostbasic8uni = [y = 0.0009680954123045289 * x^-0.6479434369803485]
```

These are then compared with an assertion, which asserts the following:

```
Two x-axis points corresponding to optimal attack size:
x1 = 1
x2 = 1000

Y-coordinates at each point, for curve named '000webhostbasic8prop':
y1 = 0.0011742221285749555 * x1^-0.6588793976685547
y2 = 0.0011742221285749555 * x2^-0.6588793976685547

Y-coordinates at each point, for curve named '000webhostbasic8uni':
y1' = 0.0009680954123045289 * x1^-0.6479434369803485
y2' = 0.0009680954123045289 * x2^-0.6479434369803485

What we are asserting:
(|y1 - y2| / |x1 - x2|) > (|y1' - y2'| / |x1 - x2|)
```

### Loading (`loading.sk`)
Demonstrates loading equations from files generated by Pyrrho of the form:

```json
{
  "amp": 0.00011059984812070353,
  "alpha": -0.17896888889001078
}
```

This is accomplished with the `load` keyword:

```
# Loading Zipf equations from files generated by Pyrrho and binding them to a name.
load equations/yahoo-basic6_basic8_proportional.json as yb8prop
load equations/yahoo-basic6_basic12_proportional.json as yb12prop

# Another assertion.
assert yb8prop steeper yb12prop between 1 and 1000
```

### Grouping `groups.sk`
Demonstrates placing equations into named groups and accessing them using `group` and `add` keywords.

```
# Loading Zipf equations from files generated by Pyrrho and binding them to a name.
load equations/yahoo-basic6_basic8_proportional.json as yb8prop
load equations/yahoo-basic6_basic12_proportional.json as yb12prop

# Build group.
group yahoo
add yb8prop to yahoo as b8
add yb12prop to yahoo as b12

# Assert using groups.
assert b8 yahoo steeper b12 yahoo between 1 and 100
```

### Ranking `ranking.sk`
Demonstrates ranking a group using the `rank` keyword.
